Goal: Explore how people organize digital content across platforms (e.g., Pinterest, Notion, Instagram Collections) and identify what makes users return to their saved content.

Methods:
	•	Conduct a competitive analysis comparing content curation tools.
	•	Interview 10 users about how they save, organize, and rediscover content across different platforms.
	•	Analyze common pain points and motivational factors driving users to revisit or abandon saved items.

Deliverables:
	•	A behavioral research case study mapping out different user personas and their saving habits.
	•	Insights into why users do (or don’t) return to saved content—with recommendations for product strategy.
	•	Comparison matrix showing strengths/weaknesses of different curation platforms.
